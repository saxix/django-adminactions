Installation
============

Installing iAdmin is as simple as checking out the source and adding it to
your project or ``PYTHONPATH``.


1. First of all follow the instruction to install `standard admin <standard_admin>`_ application,

2. Either check out iAdmin from `GitHub`_ or to pull a release off `PyPI`_. Doing ``pip install django-adminactions`` or ``easy_install django-adminactions`` is all that should be required.

3. Either symlink the ``adminactions`` directory into your project or copy the directory in. What ever works best for you.
